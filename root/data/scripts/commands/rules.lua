  DS9Mods - data/scripts/commands/rules.lua
  ------------------------------------------------

  When invoked, this command will read from a file named "RulesList.txt"
  placed within the galaxy root (the output of Server().folder). The
  syntax said file is as follows:

  ";": A comment. Lines beginning with this character are ignored

  "#": Disable formatting. Lines beginning with this character will
       simply be output as is.

  "-" or "+": These lines are formatted as a bullet point for a rule

  All other non-empty lines present are treated as new rules and are
  output with numbered formatting. Here is an source, and its output:

  Note: Leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed.

  Example Source:
    # =|Server Rules|=
    # NOTE: Simple note
    ; This is completely ignored
    Rule about something
      - More information on that rule
    Rule about something else
      + Another bit of info, but on this rule instead

  Example Output:
    =|Server Rules|=
    NOTE: Simple note
    1. Rule about something
      - More information on that rule
    2. Rule about something else
      - Another bit of info, but on this rule instead
